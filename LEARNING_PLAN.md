## Key Concepts & Technologies

### 1. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
**What are they?**
PWAs are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They combine the best of web and mobile apps.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Progressive**: Work for every user, regardless of browser choice
- **Responsive**: Fit any form factor (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- **Connectivity independent**: Work offline or on low-quality networks
- **App-like**: Feel like an app with app-style interactions
- **Fresh**: Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process
- **Safe**: Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping
- **Discoverable**: Identifiable as "applications" thanks to W3C manifests
- **Re-engageable**: Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications
- **Installable**: Allow users to "keep" apps on their home screen
- **Linkable**: Easily share via URL

### 2. Service Workers
**What are they?**
A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page. It's essentially a JavaScript file that:
- Can't directly access the DOM
- Runs on a different thread
- Acts as a programmable network proxy
- Enables offline functionality
- Handles push notifications and background sync

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Registration**: Your main JavaScript registers the service worker
2. **Installation**: Browser installs the service worker (happens once)
3. **Activation**: Service worker activates (good time to clean up old caches)
4. **Idle**: Service worker waits for events
5. **Fetch/Message**: Service worker handles events (like network requests)
6. **Terminated**: Browser can terminate idle service workers to save memory

**Key Events:**
- `install`: Fired when the service worker is first installed
- `activate`: Fired when the service worker is activated
- `fetch`: Fired when the page makes a network request
- `message`: Fired when the page sends a message to the service worker

### 3. Manifest File (manifest.json)
**What is it?**
A JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when "installed" on the user's device.

**Key Properties:**
- `name`: Full name of your app
- `short_name`: Short name for home screen
- `description`: What your app does
- `start_url`: Where the app starts when launched
- `display`: How the app should be displayed (fullscreen, standalone, minimal-ui, browser)
- `background_color`: Background color for splash screen
- `theme_color`: Theme color for the browser UI
- `icons`: Array of app icons in different sizes

### 4. Cache API
**What is it?**
A storage mechanism for Request/Response object pairs. Unlike HTTP cache, it gives you full control over what gets cached and when.

**Key Methods:**
- `caches.open(cacheName)`: Opens a cache by name
- `cache.put(request, response)`: Stores a request/response pair
- `cache.add(url)`: Fetches and caches a URL
- `cache.addAll(urls)`: Fetches and caches multiple URLs
- `cache.match(request)`: Retrieves a cached response
- `cache.delete(request)`: Removes a cached entry

### 5. Caching Strategies

#### Cache-First (Cache Falling Back to Network)
**Best for**: Static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)
**How it works**:
1. Check if the resource is in cache
2. If found, return from cache
3. If not found, fetch from network
4. Cache the network response for next time

#### Network-First (Network Falling Back to Cache)
**Best for**: Dynamic content, API calls
**How it works**:
1. Try to fetch from network first
2. If successful, update cache and return
3. If network fails, return from cache
4. If both fail, show error or offline page

#### Cache-Only
**Best for**: Resources that never change
**How it works**: Always serve from cache, never hit network

#### Network-Only
**Best for**: Real-time data that must be fresh
**How it works**: Always fetch from network, never cache

#### Stale-While-Revalidate
**Best for**: Resources that should be fresh but can tolerate being slightly outdated
**How it works**:
1. Return cached version immediately
2. Fetch fresh version in background
3. Update cache for next time
