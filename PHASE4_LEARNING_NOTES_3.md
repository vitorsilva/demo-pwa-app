## Phase 4.4: End-to-End Testing with Playwright

### What is End-to-End Testing?

**Definition:**
End-to-end (E2E) testing simulates real user interactions with your application in an actual browser. Unlike unit tests that test individual functions in isolation, E2E tests verify that the entire application works together correctly from start to finish.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Unit tests**: Testing individual car parts (brakes, engine, steering wheel)
- **E2E tests**: Taking the whole car for a test drive

**Key Differences from Unit Tests:**

| Aspect | Unit Tests | E2E Tests |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **What's tested** | Individual functions | Complete user workflows |
| **Environment** | Node.js with jsdom | Real browser |
| **Speed** | Milliseconds | Seconds |
| **Scope** | Single function | Multiple files/components |
| **Purpose** | Verify logic correctness | Verify app works end-to-end |
| **Example** | Test `updateOutput()` function | Test "user types → sees output" flow |

---

### Why End-to-End Testing?

**Problems E2E Testing Solves:**

1. **Integration Issues**: Individual functions work, but don't work together
2. **Browser Differences**: Code works in Chrome but breaks in Firefox
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Service worker, offline mode, PWA features need real browser
4. **User Perspective**: Tests what users actually experience

**Example:**
- ✅ Unit test passes: `updateOutput()` sets `textContent` correctly
- ❌ E2E test reveals: Service worker isn't caching the JavaScript file, so app breaks offline

---

### What is Playwright?

**Definition:**
Playwright is a modern browser automation framework created by Microsoft. It controls real browsers programmatically to simulate user actions and verify application behavior.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-browser support**: Chromium (Chrome/Edge), Firefox, WebKit (Safari)
- **Fast execution**: Modern architecture with parallel test execution
- **Auto-waiting**: Automatically waits for elements to be ready
- **Visual debugging**: Screenshots, videos, traces
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Developer tools**: UI mode for interactive test development

**Created by:** Microsoft (2020) - team members from Puppeteer project

---

### Playwright vs Other E2E Frameworks

#### Playwright vs Cypress

| Feature | Playwright | Cypress |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Browsers** | Chrome, Firefox, Safari | Chrome, Firefox, Edge |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Fast |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Easier |
| **UI Mode** | Yes | Yes (excellent) |
| **Multi-tab support** | Yes | Limited |
| **Best for** | Production testing | Learning, development |

**Why we chose Playwright:**
- Modern and widely adopted
- Multi-browser support (including Safari/WebKit)
- Fast and reliable
- Great VS Code integration
- Industry standard for new projects

---

### Installation and Setup

#### Step 1: Install Playwright

**Command:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

**Q: Why use `--save-dev` instead of regular install?**

**A:** Playwright is a development tool for testing. We only need it during development, not in production. Users don't run tests on the deployed app.

**Review:**
- `dependencies` = needed to **run** the app (production)
- `devDependencies` = needed to **develop/test** the app (development only)

---

#### Step 2: Download Browser Binaries

**Command:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Q: What does `npx` do differently from `npm`?**

**A:**
- `npm install <package>` = Downloads and installs package permanently
- `npx <command>` = Executes a command from an already-installed package (or temporarily downloads it)

**What this command did:**
Downloaded three browser engines:
1. **Chromium** (148.9 MB) - Open-source Chrome
2. **Firefox** (105 MB) - Mozilla browser
3. **WebKit** (57.6 MB) - Safari's engine

**Total size:** ~350 MB installed to `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\`

---

#### Q: Why Download 3 Different Browsers?

**A:** Cross-browser compatibility is crucial. Different browsers:
- Render HTML/CSS differently
- Execute JavaScript differently
- Have different bugs and quirks

A PWA might work perfectly in Chrome but have issues in Safari. Testing all three ensures it works for all users.

---

#### Q: What Does "Headless" Mean?

During installation, we saw "Chromium Headless Shell" downloaded.

**A:** Headless = no visible browser window, runs in background.

**Benefits:**
- Much faster (no UI rendering)
- Uses less memory
- Perfect for automated testing
- Required for CI/CD pipelines

**Modes:**
- **Headed**: Opens visible browser window (good for development/debugging)
- **Headless**: Runs in background (default for automated tests)

---

### Configuration File: playwright.config.js

#### Basic Structure

**Command Pattern:**
```javascript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Configuration options
});
```

**Q: This looks familiar - where did we use `defineConfig` before?**

**A:** In `vite.config.js`! Same pattern - provides TypeScript autocomplete and validation for config objects. Professional tools use this consistently.

**Q: Why `export default`?**

**A:** When you run `npx playwright test`, Playwright automatically looks for `playwright.config.js` and imports its default export. Standard Node.js tooling pattern.

---

#### Configuration Options Explained

**Full configuration we created:**

```javascript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 1,
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
});
```

**Breaking it down:**

**`testDir: './tests/e2e'`**
- Where Playwright looks for test files
- Tests in separate folder from unit tests

**Q: Why separate folder for E2E tests?**

**A:**
1. No 1:1 mapping with source files (E2E tests test workflows across multiple files)
2. Better organization (different test types clearly separated)
3. Different configurations don't conflict

---

**`timeout: 30000`**
- Maximum time (milliseconds) a test can run
- 30000 ms = 30 seconds

**Q: Why do E2E tests need longer timeouts than unit tests?**

**A:**
1. **Browser startup**: Launching browser takes 1-3 seconds
2. **User flows**: Multiple steps (navigate → type → click → wait)
3. **Real operations**: Actual page loads, network requests, rendering

Unit tests run in milliseconds. E2E tests run in seconds.

---

**`retries: 1`**
- If test fails, retry once before marking as failed

**Q: Why retry E2E tests automatically?**

**A:** E2E tests can be "flaky" (intermittently fail) due to:
1. **Timing issues**: Network slow, page loads slower than expected
2. **Race conditions**: Clicking button before it's fully loaded
3. **Network flakiness**: Real HTTP requests occasionally timeout
4. **System load**: Computer busy → slower test execution

Retrying once catches occasional flukes without masking real bugs. Unit tests don't need this because they run in controlled environment.

---

**`use` section:**

**`baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000'`**
- Base URL for the application
- `page.goto('/')` becomes `page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')`
- Makes tests portable (change baseURL once, all tests update)

**`screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`**
- Take screenshots when tests fail

**`video: 'retain-on-failure'`**
- Record videos, but only keep them when tests fail

**Video options:**
- `'off'` - No videos
- `'on'` - Record everything, keep all videos
- `'retain-on-failure'` - Record everything, only keep failures (recommended)
- `'on-first-retry'` - Only record retries

**Q: Why is `'retain-on-failure'` recommended over `'on'`?**

**A:**
- Video files are large (multiple MB per test)
- Large projects might have hundreds of tests
- Only need videos for debugging failures
- Saves disk space and CI/CD storage costs

---

**Q: Why are screenshots and videos useful for debugging?**

**A:**
1. **Headless mode**: Tests run in background, you can't see what happened
2. **CI/CD**: Tests run on remote servers - you weren't there to watch
3. **Visual debugging**: See exactly what the browser showed when it failed
4. **Reproducing issues**: Video shows step-by-step what went wrong

Huge advantage over unit tests - visual proof of failures!

---

**`projects` section:**

```javascript
projects: [
  {
    name: 'chromium',
    use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
  },
]
```

- Defines which browsers to test
- Starting with just Chromium for simplicity
- `devices['Desktop Chrome']` provides pre-configured settings (viewport size, user agent)

**Q: We downloaded 3 browsers but only testing Chromium. Why?**

**A:**
1. **Simplicity**: Faster to learn with one browser
2. **Speed**: One browser = 3x faster test runs
3. **Coverage**: Chromium covers ~65% of users
4. **Easy to expand**: Just add more to array later

**Adding all three:**
```javascript
projects: [
  { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
  { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
  { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
],
```

---

### Writing E2E Tests

#### Test File Structure

**File location:** `tests/e2e/app.spec.js`

**Naming convention:**
- `*.spec.js` or `*.test.js` files are auto-discovered
- Both work, `.spec` comes from "specification" (behavior specification testing)

**Q: Why do testing tools look for these patterns?**

**A:** Auto-discovery! Test runners use file pattern matching:
- No need to manually list every test file
- Just follow naming convention
- Tools automatically find and run all tests

---

#### Basic Test Structure

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should echo text from input to output', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Type into the input
  await page.fill('#textInput', 'Hello Playwright!');

  // Get the output text
  const outputText = await page.textContent('#textOutput');

  // Assert the output matches
  expect(outputText).toBe('Hello Playwright!');
});
```

**Key differences from unit tests:**

1. **Import source**: `from '@playwright/test'` vs `from 'vitest'`
2. **`async` function**: Test function is async
3. **Test fixtures**: `{ page }` destructured from test context
4. **`await` everywhere**: All browser operations are async

---

#### Why Tests Must Be Async

**Q: Why do E2E test functions need to be `async`?**

**A:** Browser operations are asynchronous (return Promises):
- `page.goto(url)` - Wait for page to load
- `page.fill(selector, text)` - Wait for element to exist, then type
- `page.click(selector)` - Wait for element, then click
- `page.textContent(selector)` - Wait for element, then get text

Each returns a Promise that must be `await`ed.

**Compare:**

**Unit test (synchronous):**
```javascript
test('adds numbers', () => {
  const result = add(2, 3);  // Instant
  expect(result).toBe(5);
});
```

**E2E test (asynchronous):**
```javascript
test('types text', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://...');        // Wait for page
  await page.fill('#input', 'hello');   // Wait for typing
  const text = await page.textContent('#output'); // Wait for element
  expect(text).toBe('hello');
});
```

The `async` keyword allows us to use `await`!

---

#### Page Object and Test Fixtures

```javascript
test('test name', async ({ page }) => {
  // page object provided automatically
});
```

**`{ page }`**: Playwright automatically injects test fixtures
- `page` = browser page object with methods to interact with page
- Destructured from test context
- Fresh page for each test (isolation)

**Other available fixtures:**
- `{ context }` = browser context (for multi-page tests)
- `{ browser }` = browser instance
- Can create custom fixtures

---

#### CSS Selectors

**Selecting elements:**
```javascript
await page.fill('#textInput', 'Hello');
const text = await page.textContent('#textOutput');
```

**Q: What does the `#` symbol mean?**

**A:** CSS selectors! Same syntax as:
- `document.querySelector('#textInput')` in JavaScript
- `#textInput { ... }` in CSS stylesheets

**Common selectors:**
- `#id` - ID selector
- `.class` - Class selector
- `tag` - Tag name
- `[attribute="value"]` - Attribute selector

Playwright uses CSS selectors by default because developers already know them!

---

### Our First Test: Text Echo

```javascript
test('should echo text from input to output', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  await page.fill('#textInput', 'Hello Playwright!');

  const outputText = await page.textContent('#textOutput');

  expect(outputText).toBe('Hello Playwright!');
});
```

**What it tests:**
1. Navigate to app
2. Type into input field
3. Verify output shows the typed text

**Q: Where does `http://localhost:3000` come from? We only wrote `'/'`.**

**A:** From `baseURL` in config! `page.goto('/')` → `page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')`.

---

#### Running Tests

**Q: Why do we need the dev server running in one terminal while tests run in another?**

**A:** The test runs `page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')` which makes a real HTTP request. The dev server must be running to serve the app. Not running as a background service, but in interactive mode.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run tests
npx playwright test
```

---

#### First Test Failure - Learning Moment!

**Initial test failed with:**
```
Error: page.fill: Test timeout of 45000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator('#text-input')
```

**What happened:**
- Playwright tried to find element with `id="text-input"`
- Element didn't exist
- Waited until timeout
- Test failed

**Debugging artifacts created:**
- ✅ Screenshot: `test-failed-1.png`
- ✅ Video: `video.webm`
- ✅ Retry happened automatically

**The bug:** Selector didn't match HTML!

**In test:**
```javascript
'#text-input'  // ❌ Wrong - kebab-case
'#text-output' // ❌ Wrong
```

**In HTML:**
```html
<input id="textInput">  <!-- camelCase -->
<div id="textOutput">
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
'#textInput'   // ✅ Correct
'#textOutput'  // ✅ Correct
```

**Naming conventions:**
- **camelCase**: `textInput` (used in your HTML)
- **kebab-case**: `text-input` (common in HTML attributes)

Selectors must match exactly!

---

#### Test Success!

After fixing selectors:
```
✓  1 [chromium] › tests\e2e\app.spec.js:3:5 › should echo text from input to output (2.8s)

1 passed (8.8s)
```

**Timing breakdown:**
- **2.8s**: Actual test execution
- **8.8s**: Total including browser startup overhead

Much faster than the 45s timeout when it failed!

---

### Second Test: Placeholder Text

```javascript
test('should show placeholder text when input is empty', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  const initialText = await page.textContent('#textOutput');
  expect(initialText.trim()).toBe('Your text will appear here...');
});
```

**Initial failure - whitespace issue:**
```
- Expected  - 1
+ Received  + 3

- Your text will appear here...
+
+               Your text will appear here...
+
```

**The problem:** `page.textContent()` captured whitespace from HTML formatting:
```html
<div id="textOutput">
               Your text will appear here...
</div>
```

**Solution:** Use `.trim()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace
```javascript
expect(initialText.trim()).toBe('Your text will appear here...');
```

**Q: What does `.trim()` do?**

**A:** Removes whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs) from beginning and end of string.

---

### Third Test: Offline Functionality (PWA Testing!)

This is where E2E really shines for PWAs!

```javascript
test('should work offline after initial load', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // Load page online to let service worker cache everything
  await page.goto('/');

  // Wait for service worker to install and cache files
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);

  // Simulate going offline
  await context.setOffline(true);

  // Reload page (should load from cache)
  await page.reload();

  // Test that app still works offline
  await page.fill('#textInput', 'Works offline!');
  const outputText = await page.textContent('#textOutput');
  expect(outputText.trim()).toBe('Works offline!');
});
```

**New concepts:**

**`{ page, context }`**
- Getting both `page` and `context` from test fixtures
- `context` = browser context with cross-page capabilities

**`page.waitForTimeout(2000)`**
- Wait 2 seconds (2000ms)
- Gives service worker time to install and cache files

**`context.setOffline(true)`**
- Simulates network going offline
- Like checking "Offline" in DevTools

**`page.reload()`**
- Refreshes the page
- Tests if page loads from service worker cache

**Q: Why load the page first, wait, THEN go offline? Why not start offline?**

**A:** Service workers need to:
1. Download and install first (requires network)
2. Cache the files (requires initial network requests)
3. THEN they can serve cached files offline

Starting offline would fail immediately - nothing cached yet!

---

### Playwright UI Mode

**Command:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

**Features:**
- 🎯 Visual test list
- 📸 Screenshots at each step
- ⏱️ Timeline of test execution
- 🔍 DOM inspector at each moment
- ▶️ Watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
- 🎯 Pick locator tool (click elements to get selectors)
- 🐛 Step-through debugging

**Use cases:**
- Developing new tests interactively
- Debugging failing tests visually
- Understanding what tests are doing
- Learning Playwright features

**Compared to command line:**
- Command line: Fast, CI/CD-friendly, see results quickly
- UI mode: Visual, interactive, great for development

---

### npm Scripts for E2E Testing

**Added to `package.json`:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui"
}
```

**Q: Why `test:e2e` instead of overriding the `test` script?**

**A:** Different types of tests for different purposes:
- **Unit tests** (`npm test`): Fast, run frequently, test individual functions, use Vitest
- **E2E tests** (`npm run test:e2e`): Slower, test full workflows, use real browsers, use Playwright

Different tools, different purposes, run them separately!

**Workflow:**
- Unit tests: Run constantly during development (watch mode)
- E2E tests: Run before commits or when testing full features

---

### Files and Folders Created

**Configuration:**
- `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration

**Test Files:**
- `tests/e2e/` - E2E test directory
- `tests/e2e/app.spec.js` - E2E tests for PWA

**Generated (gitignored):**
- `test-results/` - Screenshots, videos, traces from test runs
- `playwright-report/` - HTML test reports
- `playwright/.cache/` - Playwright's internal cache

**Updated:**
- `package.json` - Added Playwright dependency and test scripts
- `.gitignore` - Added test artifact folders

---

### .gitignore for Test Artifacts

**Added to `.gitignore`:**
```
# Playwright test results
test-results/
playwright-report/
playwright/.cache/
```

**Q: Why not commit test artifacts?**

**A:** They are:
- **Generated files** (created every test run)
- **Large** (especially videos)
- **Machine-specific** (screenshots may differ between computers)
- **Temporary** (useful for debugging, then disposable)

Like `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/` - generated locally, not source code.

---

### Key Takeaways

**Conceptual Understanding:**

1. **E2E Tests Provide User Perspective**
   - Test what users actually experience
   - Catch integration issues unit tests miss
   - Verify browser-specific features work

2. **Visual Debugging is Powerful**
   - Screenshots show exact failure state
   - Videos show step-by-step what happened
   - Much easier than debugging from logs alone

3. **PWA Features Need Real Browsers**
   - Service workers only work in browsers
   - Offline mode requires real network simulation
   - Unit tests can't test these features

4. **E2E Tests Are Slower but Valuable**
   - Seconds vs milliseconds for unit tests
   - But catch real-world issues
   - Balance: unit tests for logic, E2E for workflows

5. **Async/Await is Essential**
   - Browser operations are asynchronous
   - Must wait for pages to load, elements to appear
   - Playwright handles most waiting automatically

**Technical Skills Gained:**

1. **Playwright Testing Framework**
   - Installing and configuring Playwright
   - Writing async E2E tests
   - Using page object and test fixtures
   - Running tests in different modes

2. **Browser Automation**
   - Controlling real browsers programmatically
   - Filling forms, clicking buttons
   - Getting element content
   - Simulating network conditions

3. **PWA Testing Techniques**
   - Testing offline functionality
   - Verifying service worker caching
   - Simulating network offline mode
   - Testing installation flows

4. **Test Organization**
   - Separate folders for E2E vs unit tests
   - Naming conventions for test files
   - npm scripts for different test types
   - Managing test artifacts

5. **Debugging Skills**
   - Reading test failure messages
   - Using screenshots to debug visually
   - Watching video recordings of failures
   - Using Playwright UI mode interactively

**Commands Mastered:**

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test    # Install Playwright
npx playwright install                      # Download browsers
```

**Running Tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test                         # Run all tests
npm run test:e2e                           # Run E2E tests (npm script)
npm run test:e2e:ui                        # Run with UI mode
```

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev                                # Start dev server

# Terminal 2
npx playwright test                         # Run E2E tests
npx playwright test --ui                    # Interactive mode
```

  - Documented proper teaching flow (explain → ask → provide → wait → review)
  - Created clear DO/DON'T lists for Claude's behavior
  - Provided examples of correct vs incorrect teaching patterns
  - Ensured future sessions will follow instructor pattern instead of executor pattern

**Current Status:**
- Completed through Phase 4.4 (End-to-End Testing)
- Project has comprehensive testing setup:
  - Local HTTPS development (mkcert + http-server)
  - Containerized deployment (Docker + nginx)
  - Build process (Vite)
  - Unit testing (Vitest + jsdom)
  - E2E testing (Playwright)
- All Phase 4.4 learnings fully documented

**What's Next When You Resume:**
According to LEARNING_PLAN.md, the remaining optional steps in Phase 4 are:

1. **Phase 4.5: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) - Optional**
   - Automated testing on every commit
   - Automated deployment to GitHub Pages
   - Professional workflow automation
   - Lint, test, build, and deploy pipeline

2. **Phase 4.6: Advanced Containerization - Optional**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Dev containers in VS Code
   - Production optimization
   - Smaller, more efficient Docker images

**Or you could:**
- Consider Phase 4 complete and move to other projects
- Deploy your PWA to GitHub Pages
- Add more PWA features (push notifications, background sync)
- Build a new project with your skills

**Recommendation:**
Phase 4.4 completes the core learning objectives. Phase 4.5 (CI/CD) would be valuable for understanding professional deployment workflows, but is optional. You now have a solid foundation in PWA development, testing, and containerization!

---

## Phase 4.5: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

### What is CI/CD?

**Definition:**
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's a practice of automating code testing and deployment so that every code change is automatically validated and deployed to production.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Without CI/CD**: Like manually checking every bolt on a car before driving
- **With CI/CD**: Like having an automated inspection system that runs every time

---

### The Problems CI/CD Solves

**Before CI/CD (Manual Process):**
```
1. Developer writes code
2. Developer manually runs tests locally
3. Developer commits code
4. Another developer pulls code
5. Code breaks on their machine! 😱
6. Hours wasted debugging "works on my machine" issues
7. Manual deployment process
8. Human errors during deployment
```

**With CI/CD (Automated Process):**
```
1. Developer writes code
2. Developer commits and pushes
3. CI/CD automatically:
   ✓ Runs all tests
   ✓ Builds production version
   ✓ Deploys if tests pass
   ✓ Notifies if anything fails
4. All automatic, no human errors
5. Confidence that deployed code works

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**What it is:**
Automatically testing every code change as soon as it's pushed to the repository.

**What CI does:**
1. **Triggered**: Every push or pull request
2. **Fresh environment**: Spins up clean server
3. **Install**: Installs exact dependencies from package-lock.json
4. **Test**: Runs unit tests, E2E tests, builds
5. **Report**: Shows ✅ pass or ❌ fail

**Why valuable:**

**Scenario 1: Environment Differences**
- ✅ Your local: Windows, Node 18, cached packages
- ✅ CI server: Linux, Node 20, fresh install
- ✅ Catches: Platform-specific bugs, dependency issues

**Scenario 2: Incomplete Commits**
- ✅ You: Have uncommitted local files
- ✅ Tests pass locally (using uncommitted code)
- ❌ CI fails (missing files in repo)
- ✅ Catches: Forgotten commits immediately

**Scenario 3: Broke Someone Else's Code**
- ✅ You: Only tested your new feature
- ❌ Forgot: To run all tests
- ✅ CI: Runs ALL tests
- ✅ Catches: Breaking changes before merge

---

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

**What it is:**
Automatically deploying code to production when tests pass.

**What CD does:**
1. **Triggered**: Tests pass on main branch
2. **Build**: Creates optimized production build
3. **Deploy**: Automatically uploads to hosting
4. **Live**: Site updates within minutes

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Fast: From commit to live in minutes
- 🎯 Consistent: Same process every time
- 🛡️ Safe: Only deploys if tests pass
- 📦 Optimized: Production builds are minified

---

### What is GitHub Actions?

**Definition:**
GitHub Actions is GitHub's built-in CI/CD platform that runs automated workflows in response to repository events.

**How it works:**
```
You push code
    ↓
GitHub detects push event
    ↓
Reads .github/workflows/*.yml files
    ↓
Spins up virtual machines in cloud
    ↓
Executes workflow steps
    ↓
Reports success/failure
```

**Key components:**

**Workflows:**
- YAML files in `.github/workflows/`
- Define what to do when events happen
- Can have multiple workflows

**Events:**
- `push`: When code is pushed
- `pull_request`: When PR is opened
- `schedule`: Run on a schedule (cron)
- Many others

**Jobs:**
- Units of work within a workflow
- Run on virtual machines (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Can run in parallel or sequence

**Steps:**
- Individual commands within a job
- Can run shell commands or actions
- Execute sequentially

**Actions:**
- Reusable pieces of code
- Like importing a library
- Example: `actions/checkout@v4` (checks out your code)

---

### What is YAML?

**YAML** = YAML Ain't Markup Language (recursive acronym!)

**A human-readable data format for configuration files.**

**Compared to JSON:**

**JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "demo-pwa-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

**YAML (same data):**
```yaml
name: demo-pwa-app
version: 1.0.0
scripts:
  test: vitest
```

**Key YAML Rules:**

1. **Indentation matters** (like Python)
   - Use **2 spaces** (not tabs!)
   - Indentation shows hierarchy

2. **Colons separate keys and values**
   ```yaml
   key: value
   ```

3. **Hyphens create lists**
   ```yaml
   items:
     - item1
     - item2
     - item3
   ```

4. **No commas or brackets needed**
   - More readable than JSON
   - Less punctuation

**Example:**
```yaml
name: Test
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

---

### GitHub Actions Architecture

**Before GitHub Actions (Your Setup):**
```
GitHub Repository (stores code)
    ↓
GitHub Pages (serves files from main branch)
    ↓
Users access site
```

**With GitHub Actions:**
```
GitHub Repository (stores code)
    ↓
GitHub Actions (builds and tests)
    ↓
GitHub Pages (serves built artifacts)
    ↓
Users access optimized site
```

**Two Separate Systems:**

**1. GitHub Repository (Git storage)**
- Stores source code
- Version control (commits, branches)
- You see: `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`
- URL: github.com/vitorsilva/demo-pwa-app

**2. GitHub Pages (Web server)**
- Serves static files over HTTP/HTTPS
- Acts like nginx/Apache
- Users see: Your live site
- URL: vitorsilva.github.io/demo-pwa-app/

**3. GitHub Actions (CI/CD runner) - NEW!**
- Builds `dist/` folder
- Runs tests
- Uploads artifacts to Pages
- Not visible in repo tree

---

### Creating Workflow Files

#### Folder Structure

**GitHub Actions looks for:**
```
.github/workflows/
```

**Why this specific path?**
- `.github/` = Special folder for GitHub configuration
- `.github/workflows/` = Where workflow YAML files live
- GitHub automatically discovers and runs these files

**Dot-prefixed folders:**
- Configuration/tooling folders (not source code)
- Hidden by default on Mac/Linux
- Examples: `.git/`, `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`

---

### Workflow 1: test.yml (Continuous Integration)

**Purpose**: Run tests on every push to ensure code quality.

**Complete file:**
```yaml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
  pull_request:
    branches: ['**']

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test -- --run

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

      - name: Build production bundle
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload test artifacts
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: |
            test-results/
            playwright-report/
          retention-days: 7
```

---

#### Breaking Down test.yml

**Header:**
```yaml
name: Test
```
- Display name shown in GitHub's Actions tab

**Trigger:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
  pull_request:
    branches: ['**']
```
- `on: push` - Runs when you push code
- `branches: ['**']` - On ANY branch (main, feature branches)
- `pull_request` - Also runs when someone opens a PR

**Q: Why run tests on EVERY branch, not just main?**

**A:** To catch bugs in feature branches BEFORE they merge to main. Much easier to fix!

**Job definition:**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
- `jobs:` - A workflow can have multiple jobs
- `test:` - Name of this job
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` - Runs on Ubuntu Linux in GitHub's cloud

**Q: We're developing on Windows. Why run tests on Ubuntu Linux?**

**A:** Cross-platform testing! Most production servers run Linux. Catches Windows vs Linux issues.

---

**Step: Checkout code**
```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```
- `uses:` - Uses a pre-built action (like importing a library)
- `actions/checkout@v4` - Official GitHub action to download your repo
- `@v4` - Version 4 of the action
- Without this: Server would be empty, no code to test!

**Step: Setup Node.js**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
```
- Installs Node.js version 20
- `with:` - Parameters for the action
- `cache: 'npm'` - Caches node_modules for faster future runs

**Q: Why specify Node.js version 20?**

**A:** Consistency! Everyone (local dev, CI, other developers) uses the same version. Avoids "works on my Node.js version" issues.

---

**Step: Install dependencies**
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```
- `run:` - Executes a shell command
- `npm ci` - "Clean Install"

**Q: What's the difference between `npm ci` and `npm install`?**

**A:**
- `npm install` - Installs packages, can update package-lock.json
- `npm ci` - Installs EXACTLY what's in package-lock.json, faster, designed for CI
- Use `npm ci` in CI/CD, `npm install` locally

**Step: Run unit tests**
```yaml
- name: Run unit tests
  run: npm test -- --run
```
- Runs Vitest tests
- `-- --run` - Pass `--run` flag to Vitest
- Tells Vitest to run once and exit (not watch mode)

---

**Step: Install Playwright browsers**
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps
```
- Downloads Chromium, Firefox, WebKit to CI server
- `--with-deps` - Also installs system dependencies (fonts, libraries) needed on Linux

**Q: We already ran `npx playwright install` locally. Why again in CI?**

**A:** CI server starts fresh every time! No browsers pre-installed.

**Step: Run E2E tests**
```yaml
- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npm run test:e2e
```
- Runs Playwright tests
- `playwright.config.js` `webServer` section starts dev server automatically

**Step: Build production bundle**
```yaml
- name: Build production bundle
  run: npm run build
```
- Runs Vite build
- Ensures production build works
- Catches issues like missing dependencies, import errors

---

**Step: Upload test artifacts**
```yaml
- name: Upload test artifacts
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: |
      test-results/
      playwright-report/
    retention-days: 7
```
- `if: failure()` - Only runs if previous step failed
- Uploads Playwright screenshots, videos, reports
- Keeps them for 7 days
- Can download from GitHub to debug failures!

---

### Workflow 2: deploy.yml (Continuous Deployment)

**Purpose**: Deploy optimized production build to GitHub Pages when tests pass on main branch.

**Complete file:**
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build production bundle
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

---

#### Key Differences from test.yml

**1. Trigger - Main branch only**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
```
- Only runs on `main` branch pushes
- Feature branches don't deploy

**Q: Why should deploy.yml only run on the main branch?**

**A:** Main branch = production code that should be live. Feature branches are works-in-progress. Could also have staging branches deploy to staging environments!

**2. Permissions**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```
- Gives workflow permission to deploy to GitHub Pages
- `contents: read` - Read your code
- `pages: write` - Write to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - Security token for deployment

**Q: Why does deploy.yml need special permissions but test.yml doesn't?**

**A:** test.yml only reads code and runs tests. deploy.yml needs to WRITE to GitHub Pages - that requires special permissions for security.

---

**3. Environment**
```yaml
environment:
  name: github-pages
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```
- Declares this is a deployment job
- Tracks deployment history in GitHub
- Shows URL of deployed site

**4. What Gets Deployed**
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: './dist'
```
- Uploads the `dist/` folder (Vite build output)
- NOT the source files!

**Q: Currently, GitHub Pages deploys your source files directly. What's the advantage of deploying the dist/ folder instead?**

**A: Benefits of deploying `dist/`:**
1. ✅ **Minified** - Smaller files, faster downloads
2. ✅ **Bundled** - Fewer HTTP requests
3. ✅ **Hashed filenames** - Cache busting (`main-abc123.js`)
4. ✅ **Optimized** - Vite applies production optimizations

Users get a faster app! 🚀

---

### Issues Encountered and Fixed

#### Issue 1: Permissions Error

**Error:**
```
Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has permission "id-token: write"
```

**Cause:**
- GitHub Actions defaults to read-only permissions for security
- deploy.yml needs write permissions

**Fix:**
1. Go to: Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions
2. Change from "Read repository contents permission" to "Read and write permissions"
3. Save

**Why needed:** Explicitly allows workflows to deploy (write) to Pages.

---

#### Issue 2: CommonJS vs ES Modules

**Error:**
```
Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here
```

**Cause:**
- `package.json` had `"type": "commonjs"`
- But config files used ES modules (`import`/`export`)
- Mismatch confused Playwright

**Fix:**
Changed `package.json`:
```json
"type": "module"
```

**Impact assessment:**
- ✅ Config files already using ES modules
- ✅ `app.js` already using `export`
- ✅ `sw.js` runs in browser (doesn't care about package.json)
- ✅ Safe change - fixes mismatch

---

#### Issue 3: Vitest Running Playwright Tests

**Error:**
```
Vitest trying to run tests/e2e/app.spec.js
Error: Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here
```

**Cause:**
- `npm test` runs Vitest
- Vitest found `tests/e2e/app.spec.js` and tried to run it
- But that's a Playwright test file!

**Fix:**
Updated `vitest.config.js` to exclude E2E tests:
```javascript
test: {
  include: ['**/*.test.js'],
  exclude: ['node_modules', 'dist', 'tests/e2e/**'],
  coverage: {
    exclude: [
      'node_modules/',
      'dist/',
      '*.config.js',
      'sw.js',
      'tests/e2e/**'
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why needed:** Separate test runners for different test types. Vitest = unit tests, Playwright = E2E tests.

---

#### Issue 4: Path Resolution (404 Errors)

**Error:**
```
GET /assets/main-abc123.js 404 (Not Found)
GET /assets/main-xyz789.css 404 (Not Found)
GET /manifest.json 404 (Not Found)
```

**Cause:**
- Vite generated absolute paths: `/assets/main-abc123.js`
- But site deployed to subfolder: `/demo-pwa-app/`
- Should be: `/demo-pwa-app/assets/main-abc123.js`

**Fix:**
Added `base` to `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/demo-pwa-app/',  // Prepend to all asset paths
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**How it works:**
- Development (`npm run dev`): Serves at `http://localhost:3000/demo-pwa-app/`
- Production build: Paths become `/demo-pwa-app/assets/...`
- Works in both environments!

**Q: Won't this break local development?**

**A:** No! Vite dev server is smart - it still works fine. We tested it first to be sure.

---

#### Issue 5: Static Assets in Build

**Problem:**
Icons and manifest had 404 errors after deployment because Vite was processing them (hashing filenames).

**Understanding Vite's `public/` Folder:**

**Without `public/`:**
```
icons/icon-192x192.png
    ↓ Vite build
assets/icon-192x192-abc123.png  ← Hashed!
```
- manifest.json says: `"src": "icons/icon-192x192.png"`
- After build: File doesn't exist at that path anymore!

**With `public/`:**
```
public/icons/icon-192x192.png
    ↓ Vite build
icons/icon-192x192.png  ← Same path!
```
- Files copied as-is, no processing
- Paths stay exactly the same

**Fix:**
1. Created `public/` folder
2. Moved `icons/` → `public/icons/`
3. Moved `manifest.json` → `public/manifest.json`
4. Moved `sw.js` → `public/sw.js`

**When to use `public/`:**
- ✅ Files referenced by exact path
- ✅ Icons, manifests, robots.txt
- ✅ Files that must keep exact name
- ❌ JavaScript/CSS imported in code (let Vite process these)

---

#### Issue 6: Service Worker and Hashed Filenames

**Problem:**
Service worker can't know hashed filenames (`main-abc123.js` changes every build).

**Our solution (Simple):**
- Move `sw.js` to `public/` (not minified)
- Only cache static files from public/
- Let browser HTTP cache handle hashed JS/CSS files

**Updated `public/sw.js`:**
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'pwa-text-echo-v7';
const FILES_TO_CACHE = [
    '/demo-pwa-app/',
    '/demo-pwa-app/index.html',
    '/demo-pwa-app/manifest.json',
    '/demo-pwa-app/icons/icon-192x192.png',
    '/demo-pwa-app/icons/icon-512x512.png'
];
// No app.js or styles.css - they have hashed names!
```

**Why absolute paths now?**
`sw.js` is at `/demo-pwa-app/sw.js`, needs to cache files relative to site root.

**Tradeoff:**
- ✅ Simple to manage
- ✅ Reliable
- ❌ sw.js not minified (~1-2KB larger)

**Professional solution (for future):**
- Vite PWA Plugin automatically generates SW
- Knows all hashed filenames
- Minifies SW code
- More complex but production-ready

---

### GitHub Repository vs GitHub Pages

**Two Separate Systems:**

**1. GitHub Repository**
- URL: github.com/vitorsilva/demo-pwa-app
- Stores: Source code (`index.html`, `app.js`, etc.)
- Visible: All files in repo tree

**2. GitHub Pages**
- URL: vitorsilva.github.io/demo-pwa-app/
- Serves: Build artifacts from `dist/`
- Visible: Only by downloading artifacts from Actions

**Can you see the web server files?**

**Old method (Deploy from branch):**
- Pages served files directly from main branch
- What you see in repo = what Pages serves

**New method (GitHub Actions):**
- Actions builds `dist/`, uploads as artifact
- `dist/` not in repo (gitignored)
- Can download artifact from Actions tab to see what was deployed

**Q: Why not commit `dist/` to the repo?**

**A: Problems with committing build files:**
1. ❌ Local build ≠ CI build (different environments)
2. ❌ Merge conflicts every build (hash changes)
3. ❌ Repository bloat (thousands of build commits)
4. ❌ Noise in git history (hard to see real changes)
5. ❌ Multiple sources of truth (who's the authoritative builder?)

**General rule:** Never commit generated/build files. Commit source code only.

---

### Professional Workflow Achieved

**Before CI/CD:**
```
1. Write code locally
2. Manually run tests (maybe forget some)
3. Push to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages serves source files
5. Hope nothing breaks
```

**After CI/CD:**
```
1. Write code locally
2. Push to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   ✓ Runs ALL unit tests (Vitest)
   ✓ Runs ALL E2E tests (Playwright)
   ✓ Builds production bundle (Vite)
   ✓ Deploys optimized build (if main branch)
4. Confidence that deployed code works
5. Users get minified, optimized files
```

**All automatic. No human errors.**

---

### Key Takeaways

**Conceptual Understanding:**

1. **CI/CD Automates Quality Assurance**
   - Every commit tested automatically
   - Catches bugs before they reach production
   - Provides confidence in code changes

2. **Multiple Environments Catch Different Issues**
   - Your Windows machine ≠ CI Linux server
   - CI has fresh install every time
   - Cross-platform testing is valuable

3. **Deployment Should Be Automated**
   - Manual deployment is error-prone
   - Automated deployment is consistent
   - Only deploy if tests pass

4. **Production Builds Are Optimized**
   - Source code ≠ production code
   - Minification, bundling, optimization
   - Users download less, site loads faster

5. **Static Assets Need Special Handling**
   - Files with fixed paths go in `public/`
   - Processed assets get hashed names
   - Service workers cache differently

**Technical Skills Gained:**

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Creating workflow YAML files
   - Understanding events, jobs, steps
   - Using pre-built actions
   - Configuring permissions

2. **YAML Syntax**
   - Indentation-based structure
   - Key-value pairs
   - Lists with hyphens
   - Multi-line strings

3. **CI/CD Concepts**
   - Continuous Integration
   - Continuous Deployment
   - Automated testing
   - Build artifacts

4. **Vite Configuration**
   - `base` for subfolder deployment
   - `public/` folder for static assets
   - Understanding build output

5. **Debugging Workflows**
   - Reading GitHub Actions logs
   - Understanding permission errors
   - Fixing path issues
   - Module system conflicts

**Commands Mastered:**

**Git:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

**NPM:**
```bash
npm ci                    # Clean install (CI)
npm install               # Regular install (local)
npm test -- --run         # Run tests once
npm run build             # Production build
```

**GitHub Actions:**
- Workflows run automatically on push
- View at: github.com/[user]/[repo]/actions
- Download artifacts for debugging
- Re-run failed workflows

---

### Files and Folders Created

**Workflow Files:**
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI workflow (run tests)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CD workflow (deploy to Pages)

**Updated Configuration:**
- `package.json` - Changed `"type": "module"`
- `vite.config.js` - Added `base: '/demo-pwa-app/'`
- `vitest.config.js` - Excluded E2E tests
- `playwright.config.js` - Added `webServer` section

**Reorganized Structure:**
- `public/icons/` - App icons (copied as-is)
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest (copied as-is)
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker (copied as-is)

---

### Comparison: Before vs After

| Aspect | Before CI/CD | After CI/CD |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Testing** | Manual, local only | Automatic, every push |
| **Deployment** | Source files | Optimized build |
| **File sizes** | ~50KB total | ~15KB total (minified) |
| **Consistency** | Varies by developer | Same every time |
| **Confidence** | Hope it works | Know it works |
| **Speed** | Manual steps | Automatic, minutes |
| **Team** | Each person different | Everyone same process |

**What's Next When You Resume:**
According to LEARNING_PLAN.md, the remaining optional step in Phase 4 is:

1. **Phase 4.6: Advanced Containerization - Optional**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Dev containers in VS Code
   - Production optimization
   - Smaller, more efficient Docker images

**Or you could:**
- Consider Phase 4 complete (comprehensive professional setup achieved)
- Explore future topics like Vite PWA Plugin for automated SW generation
- Add more PWA features (push notifications, background sync)
- Build a new project with your skills
- Share your PWA with others

**Recommendation:**
Phase 4.5 completes the professional development workflow. You now have everything a production team would use: local development, testing, CI/CD, and deployment. Phase 4.6 would add Docker mastery, but you've already achieved the core learning objectives for modern web development!

**Congratulations on completing Phase 4.5! You now have a complete, professional-grade development and deployment pipeline!** 🎉
