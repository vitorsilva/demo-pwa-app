## Phase 4.1a: mkcert + http-server

## Local HTTPS Setup with mkcert

### Why HTTPS Locally?

**The Problem:**
- PWA features like `beforeinstallprompt` work more reliably over HTTPS
- Service workers require a secure context
- Testing in production-like environment is important
- Avoid "Not Secure" warnings in browser

**The Solution:**
Use mkcert to create locally-trusted SSL certificates for localhost development.

### What is mkcert?

**Definition:**
A tool that creates SSL certificates that your browser will trust for local development.

**Key Features:**
- Creates certificates for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and custom domains
- Automatically manages a local Certificate Authority
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Zero configuration required
- Perfect for development (not for production)

**How It Works:**
1. Creates a local Certificate Authority (CA)
2. Installs this CA in your system's trust store
3. Generates certificates signed by this CA
4. Your browser trusts the CA ‚Üí trusts the certificates

---

## WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### What is WSL?

**Definition:**
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer that lets you run a Linux environment directly on Windows without needing a virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

**Key Concepts:**
- **WSL 1**: Translation layer that converts Linux system calls to Windows calls
- **WSL 2**: Uses a real Linux kernel in a lightweight virtual machine (better performance, more compatible)
- Integrates with Windows filesystem
- Can run Linux command-line tools, utilities, and applications

### WSL Version Check

**Command:**
```bash
wsl --version
```

**What It Shows:**
- WSL version (2.x is latest)
- Kernel version
- Windows version compatibility

**Example Output:**
```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
```

### Linux Distributions in WSL

**What are Linux Distributions?**
- WSL is the "engine", but you need an actual Linux OS to run
- Common distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.
- Each distribution is a separate WSL instance

**Checking Installed Distributions:**
```bash
wsl -l -v
```

**Output Format:**
```
NAME              STATE      VERSION
Ubuntu            Running    2
docker-desktop    Stopped    2
```

- **NAME**: Distribution or application name
- **STATE**: Running or Stopped
- **VERSION**: WSL version (1 or 2)

### Installing Ubuntu in WSL

**Why Ubuntu?**
- Most popular Linux distribution for beginners
- Best package/software support
- Large community and documentation
- Default choice for development

**Installation Methods:**

**Method 1: Microsoft Store (GUI)**
1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search "Ubuntu"
3. Install "Ubuntu" (gets latest stable version)

**Method 2: Command Line (Faster)**
```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

**First-Time Setup:**
- Creates a Unix username (lowercase, no spaces)
- Sets a password (won't show characters while typing - this is normal!)
- Password is for `sudo` commands (administrator actions)

### Ubuntu Command Prompt Explained

**What You See:**
```
vitor@DESKTOP-XXXXX:~$
```

**Breaking It Down:**
- `vitor` = your Linux username
- `@` = separator
- `DESKTOP-XXXXX` = your computer's hostname
- `:` = separator
- `~` = current directory (~ means home directory)
- `$` = regular user prompt (# would mean root/admin)

### Basic Linux Commands Used

**whoami**
```bash
whoami
```
- Shows your current username
- Useful for verifying you're logged in as the right user

**sudo**
```bash
sudo command
```
- "SuperUser DO" - runs command as administrator
- Requires your password
- Needed for system-level operations

**apt (Package Manager)**
```bash
sudo apt update        # Refresh package lists
sudo apt install pkg   # Install a package
```
- Ubuntu's package manager (like an app store for Linux)
- `update` refreshes the list of available software
- `install` downloads and installs software

**cd (Change Directory)**
```bash
cd /path/to/folder
```
- Navigate to a different folder
- `~` = home directory
- `/` = root directory
- `..` = parent directory

**ls (List Files)**
```bash
ls              # Basic list
ls -la          # Detailed list with hidden files
```
- Shows files in current directory
- `-l` = long format (details)
- `-a` = all files (including hidden)

**curl (Download Files)**
```bash
curl -JLO "url"
```
- Downloads files from the internet
- `-J` = use server's filename
- `-L` = follow redirects
- `-O` = save to file

**mv (Move/Rename)**
```bash
mv oldname newname     # Rename
mv file /path/         # Move
```
- Renames or moves files
- No output = success

**chmod (Change Permissions)**
```bash
chmod +x filename
```
- Changes file permissions
- `+x` = add executable permission (make it runnable)

**cp (Copy)**
```bash
cp source destination
```
- Copies files or directories

**echo (Output Text)**
```bash
echo "text" >> file
```
- Prints text or writes to files
- `>>` = append to file
- `>` = overwrite file

### WSL Filesystem Integration

**Accessing Windows Files from WSL:**
- Windows drives are mounted under `/mnt/`
- `C:\` = `/mnt/c/`
- `D:\` = `/mnt/d/`

**Example:**
```
Windows path: C:\Users\vitor410rodrigues\source\repos\demo-pwa-app
WSL path:     /mnt/c/Users/vitor410rodrigues/source/repos/demo-pwa-app
```

**Why This Matters:**
- You can edit files in Windows (VS Code, Notepad, etc.)
- Run Linux commands on those same files in WSL
- Best of both worlds!

## Certificate Authorities Explained

### What is a Certificate Authority (CA)?

**Definition:**
A Certificate Authority is a trusted organization that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of websites and encrypt connections.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- Like a government issuing passports
- The government (CA) is trusted
- When you show your passport (certificate), people trust it's really you
- Because a trusted authority issued it

### How CAs Work in HTTPS

**The Chain of Trust:**

1. **Browser has pre-installed CAs**
   - DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, VeriSign, etc.
   - These are built into your browser/OS
   - You trust your browser ‚Üí you trust these CAs

2. **Website gets certificate from CA**
   - Website proves its identity to CA
   - CA signs a certificate for the website
   - Certificate says "I vouch for this website"

3. **You visit the website**
   - Website presents its certificate
   - Browser checks: "Was this signed by a CA I trust?"
   - If yes ‚Üí Green lock, HTTPS works
   - If no ‚Üí Warning: "Not Secure"

### Q: Don't I Already Have Local CAs in Windows?

**Question:**
"Don't I already have a local CA if I'm using Windows?"

**Answer:**
Yes, BUT those CAs won't sign certificates for localhost!

**Windows' Built-in CAs:**
- Pre-installed from companies like DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, VeriSign
- Used to verify certificates from **public websites**
- Example: When you visit `https://google.com`, Windows checks if Google's certificate was signed by a trusted CA

**The Problem:**
- Those CAs will NOT sign certificates for `localhost`
- You can't ask DigiCert for a localhost certificate
- You need your own CA specifically for development

**What mkcert Does:**
- Creates a NEW local CA (just for you, just for development)
- Installs it in Windows' trust store (alongside the existing ones)
- Now Windows trusts: DigiCert ‚úÖ, Let's Encrypt ‚úÖ, **Your Local CA** ‚úÖ
- Any certificate signed by your local CA will be trusted

### mkcert Installation Process

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt install libnss3-tools -y
```
- `libnss3-tools` = contains certutil (certificate utility)
- mkcert uses this to install CAs in system trust store

**Step 2: Download mkcert**
```bash
curl -JLO "https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64"
```
- Downloads pre-built binary from official source
- `linux/amd64` = Linux version for 64-bit processors

**Step 3: Rename and Make Executable**
```bash
mv mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 mkcert
chmod +x mkcert
```
- Simplifies the filename
- `chmod +x` = makes it executable (runnable as a program)

**Step 4: Move to System Location**
```bash
sudo mv mkcert /usr/local/bin/
```
- `/usr/local/bin/` = folder for user-installed programs
- Adding to PATH means you can run `mkcert` from anywhere

**Step 5: Verify Installation**
```bash
mkcert -version
```
- Should show version number (e.g., v1.4.4)

### Creating the Local CA

**Command:**
```bash
mkcert -install
```

**What This Does:**
1. Creates a new local Certificate Authority
2. Generates CA certificate and private key
3. Stores them in `~/.local/share/mkcert/` (on Linux)
4. Installs CA in system trust store

**Output:**
```
Created a new local CA üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
```

**Finding the CA Location:**
```bash
mkcert -CAROOT
```
- Shows path to CA files
- Example: `/home/vitor/.local/share/mkcert`

### WSL and Windows Certificate Stores

**Important Distinction:**
- WSL (Linux) has its own certificate trust store
- Windows has a separate certificate trust store
- Your browser runs on Windows, not in WSL

**Why This Matters:**
- Running `mkcert -install` in WSL installs the CA in Linux
- But your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) runs on Windows
- So we need to install the CA in Windows too

**The Solution:**
1. Copy CA from WSL to Windows: `cp /home/vitor/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem /mnt/c/Users/vitor410rodrigues/Downloads/`
2. Install CA in Windows manually (graphical process)

### Installing CA in Windows

**Process:**
1. Copy `rootCA.pem` to Windows location (Downloads folder)
2. Rename to `rootCA.crt` (Windows recognizes .crt better than .pem)
3. Right-click ‚Üí "Install Certificate"
4. Choose "Current User" (not Local Machine)
5. Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store
6. Complete installation

**Current User vs Local Machine:**
- **Current User**: Certificate only trusted for your Windows account (recommended)
- **Local Machine**: Certificate trusted for all users on computer (requires admin, unnecessary for dev)

**Why "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"?**
- This is the store for root CAs - the most trusted certificates
- Putting our CA here makes Windows trust any certificate it signs
- This is safe because the CA only works locally and only signs localhost certificates

### Generating Localhost Certificates

**Command:**
```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

**Breaking It Down:**
- `localhost` = domain name for local computer
- `127.0.0.1` = IPv4 loopback address (another way to say "this computer")
- `::1` = IPv6 loopback address

**Why Multiple Names?**
- Browser might use any of these to access your app
- Having all three in the certificate ensures it works no matter which one is used

**Output:**
```
Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"

The certificate is at "./localhost+2.pem" and the key at "./localhost+2-key.pem" ‚úÖ
It will expire on 20 January 2028 üóì
```

**Files Created:**
- `localhost+2.pem` = The certificate (public, can be shared)
- `localhost+2-key.pem` = The private key (SECRET, never share!)

**The "+2" in Filename:**
- Indicates the certificate is valid for 2 additional names beyond the first
- (localhost + 2 more: 127.0.0.1 and ::1)

## Let's Encrypt vs mkcert

### Q: Would Let's Encrypt Be a Better Approach?

**Question:**
"I know there is a thing called Let's Encrypt that gets you free certificates. Would this be a better approach?"

**Excellent question!** This shows understanding that there are multiple ways to get SSL certificates.

### Let's Encrypt

**What It's For:**
Creating certificates for **public websites** on the internet with real domain names.

**How It Works:**
1. You must own a domain name (like `example.com`, `myapp.com`)
2. Let's Encrypt verifies you own that domain
3. Verification is done by checking the domain from the internet
4. Issues a certificate trusted by all browsers worldwide

**Requirements:**
- Real domain name (costs money to register)
- Server must be publicly accessible from the internet
- Let's Encrypt servers need to reach your server to verify ownership

**Use Cases:**
- Production websites
- Deployed applications
- Public APIs
- Any site accessible from the internet

### mkcert

**What It's For:**
Creating certificates for **local development** on your own computer.

**How It Works:**
1. Creates a local Certificate Authority on your computer
2. Your computer/browser trusts this CA (only on your machine)
3. Generates certificates signed by this CA
4. Works with localhost, 127.0.0.1, and local hostnames

**Requirements:**
- Just mkcert installed
- No domain name needed
- No internet connection required
- No public server needed

**Use Cases:**
- Local development
- Testing HTTPS features
- Private development environments
- Learning and experimentation

### Why Let's Encrypt Won't Work for Localhost

**The Problem:**
- Let's Encrypt needs to verify domain ownership
- Verification happens from their servers on the internet
- They try to connect to your domain from the outside
- `localhost` is not a public domain - it only exists on your computer
- Let's Encrypt servers can't reach your `localhost`
- Therefore, verification fails

**Technical Reason:**
- `localhost` always resolves to `127.0.0.1` (your own computer)
- When Let's Encrypt tries to verify `localhost`, it checks their own server
- Not your computer!

### Comparison Table

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Local development (localhost) | **mkcert** ‚úÖ | Works with localhost, no domain needed |
| Production website with domain | **Let's Encrypt** ‚úÖ | Free, trusted globally, auto-renewal |
| Testing on your computer | **mkcert** ‚úÖ | Simple, fast, no configuration |
| Deployed to GitHub Pages | No action needed | GitHub provides HTTPS automatically |
| Deployed to Netlify/Vercel | No action needed | Platform provides HTTPS automatically |
| Custom server with domain | **Let's Encrypt** ‚úÖ | Industry standard for production |

### When You'll Use Each

**Phase 4.1 (Now - Local HTTPS):**
- Using **mkcert**
- Testing PWA features locally
- Installing app from localhost

**Later - When Deploying:**
- If using GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel: HTTPS included, nothing to do
- If deploying to your own server with custom domain: Use Let's Encrypt

## Security Best Practices

### Q: Should .pem Files Be Added to Git Repository?

**Question:**
"Can I add these 2 new files (.pem) to a public repository? Is that safe, or should I create a .gitignore for them?"

**Excellent security thinking!** ‚úÖ

### The Two Files

**localhost+2.pem (Certificate)**
- Public part of the certificate
- Relatively safe to share
- But still no benefit to committing it

**localhost+2-key.pem (Private Key)**
- **PRIVATE** - should NEVER be shared
- Anyone with this key could impersonate your localhost
- While the risk is low for localhost, it's a bad practice

### Why Keep Certificates Out of Git

**Security Best Practice:**
- Private keys should NEVER be committed to repositories
- Even for localhost certificates
- Builds good security habits for when you work with real production secrets

**Machine-Specific:**
- Certificates are tied to individual machines
- Each developer should generate their own
- No benefit to sharing them

**Clutter:**
- Certificate files aren't part of the application code
- They're local development environment setup
- Belong in .gitignore like node_modules, .env files, etc.

**General Rule:**
```
Certificates + Private Keys = Secrets
Secrets = .gitignore
```

### Adding to .gitignore

**Command:**
```bash
echo "*.pem" >> .gitignore
```

**What This Does:**
- `echo "*.pem"` = outputs the text "*.pem"
- `>>` = appends to file (or creates if doesn't exist)
- `.gitignore` = the file to append to

**Result:**
- All files ending in `.pem` will be ignored by Git
- Won't be committed or pushed
- Won't show up in `git status`

**Best Practice:**
Also add to .gitignore:
- `*.key` = private keys
- `*.crt` = certificates
- `*.pem` = certificates and keys
- `.env` = environment variables
- Secrets and credentials files

## Installing Node.js in WSL

**Why Node.js in WSL?**
- Windows and WSL are separate environments
- Programs installed on Windows don't work in WSL (and vice versa)
- We created certificates in WSL, so using Node.js in WSL is cleaner

**Installation Process:**
```bash
sudo apt update                    # Update package lists
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y     # Install Node.js and npm
node --version                     # Verify Node.js (v18.19.1)
npm --version                      # Verify npm (9.2.0)
```

**Global npm Packages:**
- Installing packages globally with `-g` requires `sudo`
- Example: `sudo npm install -g http-server`

## http-server vs Express

**Q: How does http-server compare to Express?**

**http-server:**
- Simple command-line static file server
- Zero configuration
- Just serves files as-is
- Perfect for local development and testing
- Usage: `http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem`

**Express:**
- Full web application framework
- Requires writing JavaScript code
- Used for building APIs and dynamic applications
- Database integration, authentication, custom routing
- Overkill for just serving static files

**When to use each:**
- **http-server**: Static sites, local development, PWA testing (what we're doing)
- **Express**: Backend APIs, dynamic applications, production servers with custom logic

## Serving PWA Over HTTPS

**Command:**
```bash
http-server -S -C localhost+2.pem -K localhost+2-key.pem
```

**Breaking It Down:**
- `http-server` = run the web server
- `-S` = enable SSL/HTTPS mode
- `-C localhost+2.pem` = certificate file
- `-K localhost+2-key.pem` = private key file

**What Happens:**
- Server starts on port 8080 by default
- Available at `https://localhost:8080`
- Serves all files in current directory
- Keeps running until you press Ctrl+C

**Testing in Browser:**
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:8080`
2. Look for green lock icon in address bar
3. No "Not Secure" warnings
4. No certificate errors
5. PWA loads and functions normally

**Success Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Green lock icon (certificate is trusted)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS in address bar
- ‚úÖ Service worker registers successfully
- ‚úÖ No console errors related to certificates
- ‚úÖ Install prompt can appear (beforeinstallprompt fires over HTTPS)

## VS Code WSL Integration

**Q: Can I access WSL terminal via VS Code extension?**

**Option 1: Integrated Terminal (Simple)**
- Press `Ctrl + ` ` to open terminal
- Click dropdown next to "+"
- Select "Ubuntu (WSL)" if available
- Or type `wsl` in PowerShell terminal to enter WSL

**Option 2: Remote - WSL Extension (Professional)**
- Install "Remote - WSL" extension by Microsoft
- Runs entire VS Code session in WSL context
- Better for projects stored in WSL filesystem
- More advanced setup

**For Phase 4:** Option 1 is sufficient - we're just running commands in WSL while files stay on Windows filesystem.

### Commands Mastered

**WSL:**
```bash
wsl --version                  # Check WSL version
wsl -l -v                      # List distributions
wsl --install -d Ubuntu        # Install Ubuntu
```

**Linux Basics:**
```bash
whoami                         # Current user
sudo command                   # Run as admin
apt update                     # Update package lists
apt install package            # Install software

## Personal Reflections

**On Infrastructure Setup:**

Installing and configuring this type of infrastructure has always felt like something that I as a software developer should at least know how to do... but that doesn't mean I enjoy it! :)

It's one of those foundational skills - necessary, valuable, good to understand - but not necessarily the fun part of building applications. The payoff comes when everything is set up and you can focus on actually building features.

---

**Progress Update:** Phase 4.1a is complete! ‚úÖ

We successfully:
- Installed WSL and Ubuntu
- Installed mkcert and created local Certificate Authority
- Generated SSL certificates for localhost
- Installed CA in Windows trust store
- Installed Node.js and http-server in WSL
- Served the PWA over HTTPS at https://localhost:8080
- Verified trusted HTTPS connection with green lock icon

Your PWA now runs in a production-like HTTPS environment locally!

## Phase 4.1b: Docker + nginx (Professional Approach)

### What is Docker?

**Definition:**
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package an application and all its dependencies together so it runs consistently across different environments.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of containers like shipping containers:
- Standard size and shape
- Can be moved between ships, trucks, trains
- Contents are isolated and protected
- You know exactly what's inside

**Key Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: "Works on my machine" becomes "works on every machine"
- **Isolation**: Each container has its own environment
- **Portability**: Move containers between development, testing, and production
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel (lighter than virtual machines)
- **Reproducibility**: Same Dockerfile = same container every time

### Docker Concepts

#### Containers vs Images

**Docker Image:**
- Blueprint or template for a container
- Read-only
- Created from a Dockerfile
- Like a "class" in programming

**Docker Container:**
- Running instance of an image
- Has its own filesystem, networking, processes
- Like an "object" created from a class
- Can be started, stopped, deleted

**Analogy:**
- Image = Recipe
- Container = Actual meal made from recipe

#### Dockerfile

**What It Is:**
A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

**Common Instructions:**

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine           # Base image to start from
COPY file.txt /path/        # Copy files into image
RUN command                 # Execute command during build
EXPOSE 443                  # Document which ports are used
CMD ["nginx"]               # Command to run when container starts
```

**Our Dockerfile Explained:**

```dockerfile
# Use nginx alpine (lightweight Linux distribution)
FROM nginx:alpine
```
- Starts from official nginx image (web server)
- `alpine` = minimal Linux distro (smaller image size)

```dockerfile
# Copy PWA files to nginx's default html directory
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY app.js /usr/share/nginx/html/
# ... etc
```
- Copies our PWA files into the container
- `/usr/share/nginx/html/` = where nginx serves files from

```dockerfile
# Copy SSL certificates
COPY localhost+2.pem /etc/nginx/ssl/
COPY localhost+2-key.pem /etc/nginx/ssl/
```
- Puts SSL certificates in container for HTTPS

```dockerfile
# Copy nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
- Replaces default nginx config with our custom one

```dockerfile
# Expose HTTPS port
EXPOSE 443
```
- Documents that container listens on port 443
- Doesn't actually publish the port (docker-compose does that)

#### docker-compose.yml

**What It Is:**
A YAML file that defines how to run one or more Docker containers.

**Why Use It:**
- Easier than remembering long `docker run` commands
- Define configuration once, use repeatedly
- Simple commands: `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`
- Great for multi-container applications

**Our docker-compose.yml Explained:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
```
- Specifies docker-compose file format version

```yaml
services:
  pwa:
```
- Defines a service named "pwa"
- Services are containers you want to run

```yaml
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```
- `context: .` = use current directory for build
- `dockerfile: Dockerfile` = use this Dockerfile

```yaml
    container_name: demo-pwa-app
```
- Gives container a friendly name (instead of random name)

```yaml
    ports:
      - "443:443"
```
- Maps port 443 on host ‚Üí port 443 in container
- Format: `"host:container"`
- Allows accessing `https://localhost` (port 443)

```yaml
    restart: unless-stopped
```
- Auto-restart container if it crashes
- Won't restart if manually stopped

#### .dockerignore

**What It Is:**
Like `.gitignore` but for Docker builds.

**Why Use It:**
- Excludes unnecessary files from build context
- Faster builds (less to copy)
- Smaller images (less bloat)
- Don't copy secrets or dev files into production images

**Our .dockerignore:**
- Excludes: `.git`, documentation, scripts, node_modules, etc.
- Only copies what's needed to run the PWA

### nginx Web Server

**What is nginx?**
A high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer.

**Pronunciation:** "Engine-X"

**Why nginx?**
- **Fast**: Handles thousands of concurrent connections
- **Lightweight**: Low memory footprint
- **Production-ready**: Used by Netflix, Airbnb, NASA, etc.
- **Flexible**: Web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, cache

**nginx vs http-server:**

| Feature | http-server | nginx |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Purpose | Development | Production |
| Performance | Basic | High-performance |
| Configuration | Command-line flags | Config files |
| Features | Serve static files | Web server, proxy, load balancer, caching |
| Use case | Quick local testing | Real deployments |

**Our nginx.conf Explained:**

```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```
- Configures how nginx handles connections
- `worker_connections`: Max simultaneous connections per worker process

```nginx
http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
```
- Includes MIME type definitions (tells browsers what file types are)
- `.js` = `application/javascript`, `.css` = `text/css`, etc.

```nginx
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;
```
- Creates an HTTPS server on port 443
- Responds to requests for `localhost`

```nginx
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/localhost+2.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/localhost+2-key.pem;
```
- Points to SSL certificate and private key
- Enables HTTPS

```nginx
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
```
- `root`: Where to find files to serve
- `index`: Default file to serve for directories

```nginx
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
```
- Handles all requests
- Try to find exact file, then directory, then return 404

```nginx
        location ~ ^/(sw\.js|manifest\.json)$ {
            add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, must-revalidate";
            add_header Service-Worker-Allowed "/";
        }
```
- Special handling for service worker and manifest
- Don't cache these files (always get fresh version)
- `Service-Worker-Allowed` header allows SW to control all pages

### Docker Commands Learned

**Building and Running:**
```bash
docker-compose up              # Build (if needed) and start
docker-compose up --build      # Force rebuild and start
docker-compose up -d           # Start in background (detached)
```

**Stopping:**
```bash
docker-compose down            # Stop and remove containers
Ctrl+C                         # Stop (when running in foreground)
```

**Viewing Logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs            # Show logs
docker-compose logs -f         # Follow logs (live updates)
```

**Container Management:**
```bash
docker ps                      # List running containers
docker ps -a                   # List all containers (including stopped)
docker images                  # List images
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes  # Stop and remove volumes
docker system prune            # Remove unused containers, images, networks
```

### Comparison: Phase 4.1a vs 4.1b

| Aspect | Phase 4.1a (mkcert + http-server) | Phase 4.1b (Docker + nginx) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple, quick | More involved |
| **Start Command** | `./start-https.sh` | `docker-compose up` |
| **URL** | `https://localhost:8080` | `https://localhost` |
| **Web Server** | http-server (Node.js) | nginx (production-grade) |
| **Environment** | Runs on host machine | Runs in container |
| **Production-like** | Somewhat | Very |
| **Portability** | WSL-specific | Works anywhere Docker runs |
| **Best For** | Quick testing, development | Learning DevOps, production prep |
| **Skills Gained** | Certificates, basic HTTPS | Docker, nginx, containerization |

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Phase 4.1a (mkcert + http-server) when:**
- ‚úÖ Quick local testing
- ‚úÖ Rapid development cycles
- ‚úÖ Just need HTTPS for PWA features
- ‚úÖ Don't want Docker overhead
- ‚úÖ Simplicity is priority

**Use Phase 4.1b (Docker + nginx) when:**
- ‚úÖ Want production-like environment
- ‚úÖ Learning Docker/DevOps
- ‚úÖ Testing container deployment
- ‚úÖ Need to share exact environment with team
- ‚úÖ Preparing for cloud deployment

**Both are valid!** Many developers use simple servers for development and Docker for testing/production.

### Files Created

**Docker Configuration:**
- `Dockerfile` - Instructions to build image
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
- `.dockerignore` - Files to exclude from build

**Web Server Configuration:**
- `nginx.conf` - nginx web server configuration

**Development Script (from earlier):**
- `start-https.sh` - Quick script to run http-server

### Key Takeaways - Phase 4.1b

**Conceptual Understanding:**

1. **Containers Solve Real Problems**
   - Eliminate "works on my machine" issues
   - Consistent environments across dev, test, prod
   - Isolation prevents conflicts

2. **Docker Images Are Layered**

   - Layers are cached (faster rebuilds)
   - Start from base images, add your customizations

3. **nginx Is Industry Standard**
   - Used in production by major companies
   - High performance and reliability
   - Complex but powerful configuration

4. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Dockerfile = code that builds environment
   - Version controlled, reproducible
   - Share exact setup with team

**Technical Skills Gained:**

1. **Docker Skills**
   - Writing Dockerfiles
   - Using docker-compose
   - Managing containers and images
   - Understanding containerization benefits

2. **nginx Configuration**
   - Setting up HTTPS in nginx

   - Configuring SSL/TLS
   - Setting headers for PWAs

3. **DevOps Practices**
   - Container orchestration
   - Production-like local environments
   - Infrastructure automation

**Commands Mastered:**

**Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up              # Start services
docker-compose up --build      # Rebuild and start
docker-compose up -d           # Start detached
docker-compose down            # Stop services
docker-compose logs -f         # View logs
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker ps                      # List running containers
docker images                  # List images
docker system prune            # Cleanup
```
